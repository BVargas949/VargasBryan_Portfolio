            The basic knowledge I have of Graphic Design comes from progrmas at Valley Vista Highchool. The Fist Year
            their the original Name was Digital Communistions and I followd the program for two years. During that time
            I became knowledgeable with the Programs known as Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illistrator. Their was another
            program that tuaght the usage of Abobe animate and Blender, Having an understanding of visuals I ecided to
            put those programs under my belt.
