            Below are examples of projects and prototypes i've built through the years. The web pages are some part of
            the
            independent project stacks I was given to do in West-Mec. The Words are from a few years back, they are
            examples
            of me fusing special effects. The characters are simple models before they were realized.

            This end goal for this project was to create a table displaying the Content to both Tablets and Desktops.
            Most
            of the website was aleady created, so we first made the table in HTML under the article and Worked from
            there.
            The rows and columns were created in HTML5 and they were modified using CSS3, the hiccups that I resolved
            were
            involving the Select Plan cell and using the Nth of type properties to target scpecific cells.

            Hello Hello are the words that are written. I was fusing different affects to make a very dramatic "fiery"
            effect. This involved configurations of Filters, distortion, and wind effects. Varius rotations and
            transformations were also used.
