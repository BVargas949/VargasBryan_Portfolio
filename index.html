        <h1>Bryan L. Vargas</h1>
        <p> The name's Bryan Vargas and Im aiming to be a Web Developer/Maste. As for who I am, I'm someone who
            prioritizes progress and all the things needed to both rapidly and effectivly achieve advancment. One Of my
            biggest believes is that nothing lasts forever, either you put in the effort to change a situation or it
            ends along side your life. In the end I want to be able to face as many situaitons as possible and be able
            to grow as a person. I refuse to sit still and watch evertyone else blast off.
        </p>
