            <p> The name's Bryan Vargas and Im aiming to be a Web Developer/Master. As for who I am, I'm someone who
                prioritizes progress and all the things needed to both rapidly and effectively achieve advancement. One
                Of
                my
                biggest beliefs is that nothing lasts forever, either you put in the effort to change a situation or
                it
                ends along side your life. In the end I want to be able to face as many situations as possible and be
                able
                to grow as a person. I refuse to sit still and watch everyone else blast off.
            </p>
