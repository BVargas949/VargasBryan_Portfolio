        </p>
        <p> I've usually been one to work by myself because I preferred being able to manage my own time and materials.
            Working in groups on a big project however was many times inevitable. I realized that I needed to be able
            to communicate with others in order to grow as a person.
        </p>
        <p>
            I know the world is imperfect and that things never go as planned, so I always had other ideas ready if
            something failed. I wanted the best outcome with the most profits, with this type of mindset I became the
            leader and enforced the abilities listed above.
